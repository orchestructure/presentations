# Differently Wrong: Continuous Delivery at StockX
### Presented by Mario Loria

For too long, developers at StockX have been taxed with building and deploying their code. Manually. No checks, no verification, no alerts. That's all about to change. Join Mario Loria for a trip down implementation lane on molding the coveted pipeline: Enabling unit testing, automated builds, and safe deployments all on Kubernetes, Helm, and CircleCI.

The entrance to the venue is at the BACK of the building, there is a green door that is propped open.

Food by CNCF, Location by Duo. Amazing experience? All you!
