# Securing Kubernetes and API workloads using Open Policy Agent
### Presented by Rajesh Jain (Virtually)

Open Policy Agent (a CNCF project) provides a unified toolset and framework for policy across the cloud native stack. With OPA you can use declarative and context aware policy, decouple it from the code to release, analyze, and review policies (which security and compliance teams love) without sacrificing availability or performance.

In this meetup, you will learn about OPA, the use cases of OPA and how to use OPA as an admission controller in your Kubernetes clusters.

For example, by deploying OPA as an admission controller you can ensure:
A few examples of what you can ensure with OPA:
* Whether images are pulled from a specific corporate image registry
* All resources are labeled according to your organization's guidelines,
* All Pods specify resource requests and limits.
* Prevent conflicting Ingress objects from being created.

Additionally, Rajesh is planning a special giveaway for those tuned in sometime throughout his presentation!
